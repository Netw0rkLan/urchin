## What is it?
Urchin is a reverse shell that is writen in `Python 2`. It uses `socket` to send commands over the Internet. Urchin is a reverse-shell, meaning that an attacker can host a server and get the victim to run a client. The client will connect the user to the server, which will grant the attacker shell access to the victim's computer.
